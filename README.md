# emacs-haskell-config

A quick and easy pre-configured Emacs for developing with Haskell

Dependencies are included or explicitly stated.

## Prerequisites

It's easier if you're running Linux or OS X. If you're on Windows,
there is no guarantee whether anything described will work.

You need GHC version GHC 7.8.3â€”7.8.3. Check that with:

    $ ghc --version
    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.8.2

You need `cabal` installed. It shouldn't be particularly important
which version you have as long as it isn't ancient.

    $ cabal --version
    cabal-install version 1.20.0.3
    using version 1.20.0.2 of the Cabal library

Make sure your `~/.cabal/bin` is in your `PATH`.

## Download

Run the following to clone this repo and its dependencies:

    $ git clone https://github.com/chrisdone/emacs-haskell-config.git --recursive

That should take about a minute or two.

## Install

Install structured-haskell-mode:

    $ cabal install packages/structured-haskell-mode/

Install ghci-ng:

    $ cabal install packages/ghci-ng/

Install hindent:

    $ cabal install packages/hindent/

## Build

Build the haskell-mode Elisp:

    $ cd packages/haskell-mode/
    $ make

Build the structured-haskell-mode Elisp:

    $ cd packages/structured-haskell-mode/elisp/
    $ make

## Running

In the repo directory, run this:

    $ emacs -Q -l init.el

The `-Q` is short for "quick" and means it will not use any existing
Emacs configuration that you already have.

The `-l init.el` will load this repo's init configuration.

If you decide you want to use this configuration as-is or as a base,
you can put the following in your `~/.emacs` file:

    (load "/path/to/emacs-haskell-config/init.el")

Then run Emacs from the terminal as simply:

    $ emacs & disown

You need to run it from the terminal to ensure that your `PATH` is
configured, otherwise it's more difficult to setup.
